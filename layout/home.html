<p>In one of my several lives, I am supposed to be a writer. In this silly blog, I am trying to learn that.</p>

<h1>Wisdom</h1>
<p>When I come by of a quote that makes living a little easier, I collect them here.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
<p>Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they'll go through anything. You read and you're pierced.</p></blockquote>
<p>—Aldous Huxley, <cite>Brave New World</cite></p>

<section>
<h1>Words</h1>
<p>If I find a word I don't know, I collect it here. Sometimes I encounter a word that I really like, e.g. I like the way it sounds, or I like it's meaning. That is when I collect them here.</p>
