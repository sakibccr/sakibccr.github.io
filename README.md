This is a small Python script to build my website from markdown files. Originally, it was a fork of Sunaina Pai's awesome [makesite.py](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite). Now the script has deviated so much that it can be called entirely different from that.

The website can be viewed [here](https://reveille.xyz/).
