Eshi’s cat passed away three days ago in an unfortunate accident involving a motor vehicle. He was rushed to the hospital but, sadly, couldn’t be saved.

Eshi is understandably devastated.

Before its death, the cat must have gone through a lot of pain. But what was the purpose of this pain? Does pain have any usefulness?

From an evolutionary perspective, pain is a defense mechanism. Without it, no animal would try to protect itself, and life might have died out long before the emergence of any lifeform capable of asking such questions.

So, pain, it turns out, has value. But in this case, the cat died despite enduring it. Suffering didn’t save its life. For the cat, it was just suffering, with no reward in the end. That feels unfair.

Then again, the laws of nature don’t account for fairness. Even if the cat had survived after enduring the pain, what difference would it have made— it would die eventually and possibly painfully. What difference does anything ever make to anything or anyone? Ultimately, perhaps, none. It’s all meaningless.

Rest in peace, Tufan. Eshi's world is a little less without you.
