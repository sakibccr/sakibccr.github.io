Recently, I came across an introspective question:

> What do you believe you are here for and what prevents you from living that way?

For the first part of the question, most people would say things like "to be happy", "to take care of my family", "to make money", "god's plan", "to enjoy life". These answers may sound different. But they orbit the same few ideas: security, love, purpose, relief from pain.

Underneath though, a lot of these answers would translate to "I want to matter", "I don't want to be in pain", "I am tired", "I want to be seen". Even people with power would often reveal fear. Even people with little would often reveal dignity.

So what stops them from getting what they want? Common answers would be ordinary: fear of loosing what they already have, other people's expectation, debt, shame, trauma, time, disbeliefs etc.

Most obstacles wouldn't be external. They'd be internalized versions of something external that happened long ago.

The pattern here is this:

> People know, roughly, how they want to live.
> They don't believe they're allowed to.

Not by society. Not by fate. By an invisible permission structure they never remember agreeing to.

But the gap between our lives and meaning has a shape. And shapes can be crossed.
