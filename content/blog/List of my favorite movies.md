<!-- title:  An incomplete list of my favorite movies-->

I like to think myself as a movie buff. Long time ago, there was a low time in my life. At that time, movies were my only escape.

Now I have a family, a demanding job so I don't find the time to enjoy movies like before. But I still myself find thinking about them. I loved being immersed into the movie world. It was like meditation for me.

Today I thought I would make a list of my most favorite movies. It can't be a complete list. Also I feel about a particular movie differently in different times. But I still think I should make a list. So here it goes, in no particular order:

### 1. The Iron Giant
This is one of my most favorite movies. Its a kid movie and I watched it during university time. But I still loved it.

### 2. Zathura
This one was suggested by a friend at that time. And I was pleasantly surprised watching this. So many twists and turns. But in the end it's such a warm feeling movie. Watched it more than once and loved more each time.

### 3. Roman Holiday
This one doesn't need a description from me. Much has been discussed about this masterpiece. I loved how the movie was so gentle and classy.

That's all for today. I have many more, but today not feeling like writing anymore. Maybe another day. 👋
