My name is _Sakib Hasan_. I am a Dhaka based software developer. My main specialties are software architecture and all things Python.

I am an enthusiastic problem solver. I believe anyone can solve any problem with the right tools and environment. But most don't know that yet always.

If you want to reach out to me, shoot me an email: <em>me</em> at <em>reveille</em> dot <em>xyz</em>.

Thanks for stopping by! Come again soon!
