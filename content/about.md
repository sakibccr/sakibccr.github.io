My name is _Sakib Hasan_. I am a Dhaka based software developer. My main specialties are software architecture and all things Python.

I am an enthusiastic problem solver. I believe anyone can solve any problem with the right tools and environment. But most people just don't know that yet.

If you want to reach out to me, don't hesitate to send an email. I always reply to emails. Here's my address: sakib _at_ reveille.xyz.

Thanks for stopping by! Come again soon!
