This website is built using [a Python script](https://github.com/sakibccr/sakibccr.github.io/blob/2c10ac041897e31e3edba791951da951e7d3cf5e/makesite.py) developed with the help of an LLM. The idea of a small Python script to do this came from the elegent [makesite.py](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite). Doing this instead of using static site generators like Hugo, Jekyll or Pelican gives me the freedom to do it my way. One downside to this though is the build time, which is no where near the SSGs.
