This website is built using a single file static site generator written by me. The idea and inspiration of a small Python script to do this came from the elegent [makesite.py](https://github.com/sunainapai/makesite).

Doing this instead of using Hugo, Jekyll or Pelican gives me the freedom to do it my way. One downside to this though is the longer build times.
